# Udacity Hybrid Cloud Engineer: Course 3: Project
## Hybrid Cloud SaaS: Three-tier web application

Our fictitious example company is **The E-Commerce Company,** with a stock symbol of **TECC**, hence you will see naming standards which use: tecc.

The TECC Software Release manager has coordinated with the Database Administrator team to define a test application and test database schema:

- tecc_webuser@webapp.[tecc_dba_test.sql](tecc_dba_test.sql)
- [tecc_dba_test.php](tecc_dba_test.php)

The test application and database are used to verify a new workload deployment has a baseline of connectivity and functionality to insure developer productivity "out of the box," including ad-hoc database operations:

- [database backup](MySQL_backup_file.sh.txt)
- [database restore](MySQL_restore.sh.txt)
